# Puppy-Love

## Description

What: Our motivation for this project was to provide a puppy dating site where a user could upload their pets to the site and find other users' pets. Our efforts have allowed the user to login and create multiple pets with their own name, gender, birthday, likes, and aboutme biography. The user can then choose to update or delete their pets' information, with the changes reflecting on the site and the database. The user can also view the pet gallery, to see all pets. The user can then choose to filter the results to view specific pets via their gender and likes. When the user clicks on the desired pet, it brings the user to that pets' profile page. Our project should stand out for its unique concept and search/filter ability.

## Features

The website has a searchbar that allows the user to type in their own input for the artist's name, followed by a choice of clicking Search or hitting Enter on their keyboard to see results. The website hides the Ticketmaster and NewsApi sections until the user inputs an artists' name for the first time to streamline the appearance of the webpage. The website uses 2 APIs; Ticketmaster for finding attractions, and NewsApi for finding news about the artist. The website will display a "no results found" if no data regarding the entered artist is found.

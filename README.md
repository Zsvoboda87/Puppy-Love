# Puppy-Love

## Description

What: Our motivation for this project was to provide a puppy dating site where a user could upload their pets to the site and find other users' pets. Our efforts have allowed the user to login and create multiple pets with their own name, gender, birthday, likes, and aboutme biography. The user can then choose to update or delete their pets' information, with the changes reflecting on the site and the database. The user can also view the pet gallery, to see all pets. When the user clicks on the desired pet, it brings the user to that pets' profile page. Our project should stand out for its unique concept.
